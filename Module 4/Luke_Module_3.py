###### 3.1.1.4
#write a simple two-line program that takes the parameter n as input, which is an integer, 
#and prints False if n is less than 100, and True if n is greater than or equal to 100

n = int(input("Type a number: ")) # allows the input after the string
print(n >= 100) #true/false reply if n greater or equal to 100

#Write a program that utilizes the concept of conditional execution, takes a string as input, and
#prints "Yes - Spathiphyllum is the best plant ever!" to the screen if the inputted string is "Spathiphyllum" (upper-case)
#prints "No, I want a big Spathiphyllum!" if the inputted string is "spathiphyllum" (lower-case)
#prints "Spathiphyllum! Not [input]!" otherwise. Note: [input] is the string taken as input.

####3.1.1.11

#Your task is to write a tax calculator
#It should accept one floating-point value: the income
#Next it should print the calculated tax, rounded to full thalers. 
#There's a function named round() which will do the rounding for you - you'll find it in the skeleton code in the editor.
#If the calculated tax is less than zero, it only means no tax at all 
#(the tax is equal to zero). Take this into consideration during your calculations.

income = float(input("Enter the annual income: "))

if income <= 85528: #lower value of tax
    tax = income * .18 #finds 18 percent of the income (tax)

else: 
    tax = 14839.02 #higher value of tax
    extra = income - 85528
    extra_tax = extra * .32 #finds 32 percent of the income (tax)

#Since the introduction of the Gregorian calendar (in 1582), 
#the following rule is used to determine the kind of year:
#if the year number isn't divisible by four, it's a common year;
#otherwise, if the year number isn't divisible by 100, it's a leap year;
#otherwise, if the year number isn't divisible by 400, it's a common year;
#otherwise, it's a leap year.
#It would be good to verify if the entered year falls into the Gregorian era, 
#and output a warning otherwise: Not within the Gregorian calendar period.

year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

if year < 1582: #if less than 1582 then its is not within the Gregorian era and does not count
